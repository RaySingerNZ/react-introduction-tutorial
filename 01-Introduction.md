# Introduction - What am I building?

I am starting with an html version of am employee C.V. manager app designed to showcase a 
software service companies employees' skills, describing the projects they have been involved in and the technologies they
are experts in as individuals. This a good way to start a React application as its a good exercise in breaking
the markup and behavior down into components.

I have created the basic HTML version of the app using the [MaterializeCss](http://materializecss.com/) CSS framework for
styling. To see this in action run:

```
npm run static
```

This will launch your browser and you can see the static version of the site. If you click on the "View C.V."
button for the top item you will see the static html version of an employees profile page.

### Project structure

If you have checkout of the branch `step-0` you will have a project structure like this:

``` 
React-Introduction/
 ├──src/                * The React app files
 |   ├──api/            * Simple mock API for employee data
 │   │
 |   ├──images/         * The images for the app
 │   │  
 |   └──index.js        * The entry point to the app
 |
 ├──Static/             * The static HTML that I have started with
 │
 |
 ├──Index.html          * The html page the React app is being rendered 
 |
 └──....                * Project setup related files
```
*Some detail has been omitted for clarity*

## The Root Component

The file `src/index.js` is where I bootstrap my employee app. Although (as explained later) React 
does not use HTML templates I need to tell React where in our `index.html` file we would like to render our app.

I've done this using the `ReactDOM` library which is a separate library to the core React library and allows
you to render your component hierarchy to a DOM node in your HTML like so:

``` javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

ReactDOM.render(
  <div className="App">
    Hello World!
  </div>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

At the top I import both React (this must be in scope if using JSX) and ReactDOM. Then I call the 
[`ReactDOM.render()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/01/react-render-and-top-level-api.html) method. 
This method takes two arguments. The first argument a single component or HTML element and second argument is the DOM element 
that the app is to be rendered in. 

In this case I am using a `<div>` containing "Hello World!" as the component and a `<div>` that has an `id` of `root` as the DOM element.  
In `index.html` I have:

``` html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>React App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/0.97.7/css/materialize.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

I am also using the CDN version of materializeCSS as a simple way to pull in a styling framework. 

If you run `npm start` from your command line then you 
will see this render as a blank page with the "Hello World!" Message at the top left, just like a normal HTML page.


This should reload when you make changes or switch branches but sometimes the `create-react-app` build configuration doesn't work and you need to restart it. 
There are better build systems (or you can create your own) but I'm using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
because it keeps all the bundling and non-react noise out of the project.
