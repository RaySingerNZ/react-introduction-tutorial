# Introduction to React

This repository has been created as an introduction to the main features of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) 
and [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router). It was created using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

This tutorial has a git repository that you can find the setup instructions in the [README here](https://github.com/justsayno/react-introduction).

Although not required you can follow the code changes in each step on your local machine by cloning the repository and checkout out the 
branch that corresponds to the step in the tutorial. For example to go to the beginning run the following in a command window:

``` shell
git checkout step-0
```

Each step of the tutorial will have the git command that you need to see the code for that step.
